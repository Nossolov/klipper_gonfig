   # This file serves as documentation for config parameters of delta
# style printers. One may copy and edit this file to configure a new
# delta printer. Only parameters unique to delta printers are

# common config parameters.

# The stepper_a section describes the stepper controlling the front
# left tower (at 210 degrees). This section also controls the homing
# parameters (homing_speed, homing_retract_dist) for all towers.

#position_endstop: 448.0 
#   Distance (in mm) between the nozzle and the bed when the nozzle is
#   in the center of the build area and the endstop triggers. This

#arm_length: 426.51
#   Length (in mm) of the diagonal rod that connects this tower to the

#   stepper_b and stepper_c this parameter defaults to the value
#   specified for stepper_a.
#angle:
#   This option specifies the angle (in degrees) that the tower is
#   at. The default is 210 for stepper_a, 330 for stepper_b, and 90
#   for stepper_c.

# The stepper_b section describes the stepper controlling the front
# right tower (at 330 degrees).

min_temp: 0
max_temp: 240
max_extrude_only_distance: 300.0
#   Maximum length (in mm of raw filament) that a retraction or
#   extrude-only move may have. If a retraction or extrude-only move
#   requests a distance greater than this value it will cause an error
#   to be returned. The default is 50mm.
max_extrude_only_velocity: 20
#max_extrude_only_accel:
#   Maximum velocity (in mm/s) and acceleration (in mm/s^2) of the
#   extruder motor for retractions and extrude-only moves. These
#   settings do not place any limit on normal printing moves. If not
#   specified then they are calculated to match the limit an XY
#   printing move with a cross section of 4.0*nozzle_diameter^2 would
#   have.
max_extrude_cross_section: 0.6
#   Maximum area (in mm^2) of an extrusion cross section (eg,
#   extrusion width multiplied by layer height). This setting prevents
#   excessive amounts of extrusion during relatively small XY moves.
#   If a move requests an extrusion rate that would exceed this value
#   it will cause an error to be returned. The default is: 4.0 *
#   nozzle_diameter^2

[printer]
kinematics: delta
#   This option must be "delta" for linear delta printers.
max_velocity: 130
#   Maximum velocity (in mm/s) of the toolhead relative to the
#   print. This parameter must be specified.
max_accel: 2700
#   Maximum acceleration (in mm/s^2) of the toolhead relative to the
#   print. This parameter must be specified.
max_z_velocity: 31
#   For delta printers this limits the maximum velocity (in mm/s) of
#   moves with z axis movement. This setting can be used to reduce the
#   maximum speed of up/down moves (which require a higher step rate
#   than other moves on a delta printer). The default is to use
#   max_velocity for max_z_velocity.
minimum_z_position: -6
#   The minimum Z position that the user may command the head to move
#   to.  The default is 0.
#delta_radius: 234.84
#   Radius (in mm) of the horizontal circle formed by the three linear
#   axis towers. This parameter may also be calculated as:
#    delta_radius = smooth_rod_offset - effector_offset - carriage_offset
#   This parameter must be provided.

# The delta_calibrate section enables a DELTA_CALIBRATE extended
# g-code command that can calibrate the tower endstop positions and
# angles.
[delta_calibrate]
radius: 100
#   Radius (in mm) of the area that may be probed. This is the radius
#   of nozzle coordinates to be probed; if using an automatic probe
#   with an XY offset then choose a radius small enough so that the
#   probe always fits over the bed. This parameter must be provided.
speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
horizontal_move_z: 2
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
# samples: 1
#   The number of times to probe each point.  The probed z-values will
#   be averaged. The default is to probe 1 time.
# sample_retract_dist: 2.0
#   The distance (in mm) to retract between each sample if sampling
#   more than once. The default is 2mm.
#
#
# Z height probe. One may define this section to enable Z height
# probing hardware. When this section is enabled, PROBE and
# QUERY_PROBE extended g-code commands become available. The probe
# section also creates a virtual "probe:z_virtual_endstop" pin. One
# may set the stepper_z endstop_pin to this virtual pin on cartesian
# style printers that use the probe in place of a z endstop. If using
# "probe:z_virtual_endstop" then do not define a position_endstop in
# the stepper_z config section.
[probe]
pin: ^ar18
#   Probe detection pin. This parameter must be provided.
x_offset: 58.5
#   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
#   x-axis. The default is 0.
y_offset: -42.3
#   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
#   y-axis. The default is 0.
z_offset:10.099
#   The distance (in mm) between the bed and the nozzle when the probe
#   triggers. This parameter must be provided.
speed: 5.0
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when probing. The default is 5mm/s.
#

# Pause/Resume functionality with support of position capture and restore
[pause_resume]
recover_velocity: 50.
#   When capture/restore is enabled, the speed at which to return to
#   the captured position (in mm/s).  Default is 50.0 mm/s.
